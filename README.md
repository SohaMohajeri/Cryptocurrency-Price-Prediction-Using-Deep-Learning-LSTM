Although machine learning has been successful in predicting stock market prices through a host of different time series models, its application in predicting cryptocurrency prices has been quite restrictive. The reason behind this is obvious as prices of cryptocurrencies depend on a lot of factors like technological progress, internal competition, pressure on the markets to deliver, economic problems, security issues, political factor etc. Their high volatility leads to the great potential of high profit if intelligent inventing strategies are taken. Unfortunately, due to their lack of indexes, cryptocurrencies are relatively unpredictable compared to traditional financial predictions like stock market prediction. In this notebook, I will be going through a four step process to predict cryptocurrency prices:

- Getting real-time crptocurrency data.

- Prepare data for training and testing (split data, Normalize data)

- Predict the price of crptocurrency using LSTM neural network.

- Visualize the prediction results.
